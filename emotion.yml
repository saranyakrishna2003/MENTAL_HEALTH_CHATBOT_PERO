 That's no problem. I can see why you'd be stressed out about that. I can suggest you some tips to alleviate this issue. Would you like to learn more about that?
 ok sure. i would like to learn more about it.
 So first I would suggest you to give yourself a break. Thinking more and more about the problem definitely does not help in solving it. You'll just end up overwhelming yourself.
 yeah you're right. i deserve a break.
 Next, I would suggest you to practice meditation. Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind.
 hmmm that sounds like it could be useful to me.
 Focus all your attention on your breathing. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you inhale and exhale through your nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your attention wanders, gently return your focus to your breathing.
 i did what you said and i feel alot better. thank you very much.
 Your welcome. Remember: Always focus on what's within your control. When you find yourself worrying, take a minute to examine the things you have control over. You can't prevent a storm from coming but you can prepare for it. You can't control how someone else behaves, but you can control how you react. Recognize that sometimes, all you can control is your effort and your attitude. When you put your energy into the things you can control, you'll be much more effective.
 thank you very much again. i'll continue practicing meditation and focus on what i can control.
 I'm glad you found this useful. Is there something else I can help you with?
 nothing
 I want some advice.
 Sure. What can I do to help?
